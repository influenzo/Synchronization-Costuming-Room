Once you have completed your solution, explain how your solution maximizes profits while not depriving one side or the other of the costume department. Your description should include the output of an example run and an analysis of your synchronization scheme in the context of that run.  Save this in a text file,problem1explanation.txt, accompanying your code.

Matthew Selva and Lorenzo DeSimone
Project 3 Problem Explanation

To maximize profit, our solution uses locks as a tool to aid the flow of customers in the costume room. 
One lock is used for the pirates and ninjas. One lock is used for the 2-4 costuming teams, totalling in two locks.
Each time a team is occupied with pirates or ninjas, they will aquire the aforementioned lock, and each time any other predefined, global variable is accessed, the second lock will be aquired. 
A thread is represented by each pirate and ninja calling a function specific to that type of character that does the same thing. 
Since only an average arrival time can be specified, and not an exact arrival time for each pirate or ninja, disparities can occur where many pirates or ninjas
arrive within close proximity to each other, creating a backup in the queue for the costume room.
We only allow enough many pirates and ninjas in the room such that the wait time stays below 30 seconds, thus avoiding a gold penalty of a free costume. 
When the wait time nears 30 seconds, the costuming room swaps characters, avoiding starvation.

Our output file shows an example of our program, being run with 15 pirates, 12 ninjas, and 4 teams.
The following is the direct and complete output of our code. I hope you enjoy reading it.

 -- Costuming Department Bill -- 
Pirates owed a total of 90 gold pieces.
Ninjas owed a total of 57 gold pieces.
Expenses for employing the costume teams is 20 gold pieces.
Team 0 was busy for 51 minutes and free for 83 minutes.
Team 1 was busy for 51 minutes and free for 83 minutes.
Team 2 was busy for 24 minutes and free for 110 minutes.
Team 3 was busy for 34 minutes and free for 100 minutes.
Average queue length was 3 customers.
Gross Revenue is 147 gold pieces.
Average gold per visit was 5 gold pieces.
Total revenue was 127 gold pieces.



As was expected, there were less ninjas than pirates, and ninjas were faster than the pirates and spent about 66% of the gold that the pirates did.
Some ninjs/pirates returned which the program made note of. The program ran as expected, handling the ninjas first to a certain point, then switching to pirates and handling them until switching back to the ninjas.
